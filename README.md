# OpenGL tutorial
 Repository originally created to store the various versions of a follow-along youtube tutorial on https://thecherno.com/opengl mixed with information on https://learnopengl.com/

The aim is to acquire the technical skills necessary to work in an OpenGL environment comfortably whilst contemporaneously building up a *sufficiently* efficient implementation of an engine that can run common lightning models in real-time

The Application is currently being refactored in the **custom-refactor** branch with a different implementation than that of the tutorial, mainly to:
- Allow for more experience to be gathered from my part
- Allow the codebase to be more in line with C++'s O.O.P principles
- Make an implementation that is both more scalable, more efficient and larger in scope than that of a simple tutorial
- And last but not least, to have a codebase that I can truly call *my own*

## Main Aims of the Project

The features that I wish to add to the codebase by the end of this experiment are:
- Batch/Instanced Rendering.
- Model loading from external sources.
- Texture loading from external sources.
- Rudimentary GUI with which to interact with objects.
- An implementation of [Phong's lightning model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model "Let's be honest, you probably know it already... ").
